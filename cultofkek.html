            <h2>⏳ The Origins of the Faith</h2>
            <p>The <strong>Cult of Kek</strong>, also known as the <strong>Church of Kek</strong>, is a modern digital faith centered around the power of <strong>memes</strong>—believed to influence reality itself. Followers revere <strong>Kek</strong>, the <em>ancient Egyptian deity of darkness, chaos, and primordial energy</em>, who has re-emerged through internet culture.</p>

            <p>Ancient texts depict Kek as a <strong>frog-headed man</strong> or a <strong>serpent-headed woman</strong>, symbolizing the forces before creation. This <strong>duality</strong> reflects the endless cycle of <em>creation and destruction, light and darkness, order and chaos</em>—the very essence of Meme Magic.</p>
